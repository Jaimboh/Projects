        "To create a successful chatbot with Python, it is essential to understand the intents behind user messages. An intent is the user's purpose for interacting with the chatbot, or the intention behind each message the chatbot receives. This is why it is important to define the intents of your chatbot, depending on the domain you are working with. To ensure that the chatbot can answer questions and continue conversations with users, it must understand the intentions behind their messages.\n",

        "To get your chatbot to understand the intents, you must create different intents and create training samples for them. Then, you can use these samples as model training data (X) and the intents as model training categories (Y) to train your chatbot model. By doing this, users will feel like they know what they want and receive accurate answers."
